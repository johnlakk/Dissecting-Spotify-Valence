# Spotify Valence Metric Investigation

This repository contains the findings and analysis of an investigation into Spotify's valence metric. Valence is a measure of the happiness or mood of a track, and it plays a significant role in Spotify's music recommendation algorithms.

## Introduction
Spotify's valence metric was originally developed by Echo Nest, a company acquired by Spotify in 2014. Despite its importance, the exact calculation method of valence remains somewhat mysterious. This investigation aims to shed light on how valence might be derived.

## Methodology
To uncover the details behind Spotify's valence metric, we employed the following methods and resources:

  * Echo Nest Blog Post: We referred to an archived Echo Nest blog post that provides some insights into the calculation of valence.

  * Spotify Developer Documentation: We explored Spotify's developer documentation, specifically the Get Track's Audio Features and Get Track's Audio Analysis endpoints, to gather information about available audio features and analysis data.
